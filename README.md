# Vehicle Project README

This project is a project developed in Python(for some utilities& useful tool scripts) and C++(core module for navigation and map building) by Yuting Yang(SSE, School of Software Engineering) and Yang Xu(SMAE, School of Mechanic and Automotive Engineering) @ SCUT(South China University of Technology).

We aimed to implement autonomous navigation, stable and robust communication with STM32F103C8T6 vehicle driver board, autonomous direction controlling for vehicle functions in this project.

The project is comprised by following parts:
- Map building module
- Auto navigation module
- UART communicating module
- Motion controller module
- ARUCO locating module

# Map building

# Thanks

We have to say thanks to our teammates who have devoted a lot in the vehicle platform building work. They are:
- Yongxi Ke: help developed the mechanic structure and the electronic controller system.
- Yuxi Peng: leading the electronic controller system designing and engineering work in the team, he designed the whole electronic controller board and the embedded system on STM32F103C8T6 MCU.
- Yikai Huang: leading the mechanic structure engineering work for vehicle platform. also, he helped building the vehicle and updatig structure solution along the development timeline.

Without their devotion and dedicated work, we cannot make our vision and auto navigation project run on the real vehicle platform, while we cannot finish the Robot Contest, too.

Thanks for reading this documentation.

If you have issues or suggestions for this project, please just send us issues or fork the project, fix the problem and send us a Pull Request. I will cherish every contribution made to this small project!
